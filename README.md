Wikiwand Reloaded
================================
Redirects Wikipedia to Wikiwand.com. Not an official extension! It's a lightweight replacement for the [official Wikiwand extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikiwand-wikipedia-modernized/).

Compatible with every browser that supports WebExtensions (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, etc.). Check the [releases](https://github.com/Brawl345/Wikiwand-Reloaded/releases) page for downloads.

**NOTE:** For Edge, you have to replace "`chrome.`" in `background.js` with "`browser.`".
